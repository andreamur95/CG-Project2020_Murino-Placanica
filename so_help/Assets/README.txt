Here you have the boat's model with some textures.
Use the diffuse one for colouring the boat.
Up to you to use the other provided textures.
There are a couple of models of rocks but feel free
to use other ones if you don't like them.
For the sea you can use a plane under the boat with
a possibly nice texture :)
